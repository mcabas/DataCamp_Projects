# Project: The Android App Market on Google Play
#
# 1. Google Play Store apps and reviews
#
# Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative.
# Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed.
# In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app
# market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different
# categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to
# drive growth and retention.

# Let's take a look at the data, which consists of two files:
#
#     apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play.
#     There are 13 features that describe a given app.
#     user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first.
#     The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three
#     new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity
#     and Sentiment Subjectivity.

# Read in dataset
import pandas as pd
apps_with_duplicates = pd.read_csv('datasets/apps.csv')

# Drop duplicates from apps_with_duplicates
apps = apps_with_duplicates.drop_duplicates(subset=["App"])

# Print the total number of apps
print('Total number of apps in the dataset = ', apps.groupby(["App"]).count())

# Have a look at a random sample of 5 rows
print(apps.head())

# 2. Data cleaning
#
# Data cleaning is one of the most essential subtask any data science project. Although it can be a very tedious
# process, it's worth should never be undermined.
#
# By looking at a random sample of the dataset rows (from the above task), we observe that some entries in the
# columns like Installs and Price have a few special characters (+ , $</code>) due to the way the numbers have
# been represented. This prevents the columns from being purely numeric, making it difficult to use them in
# subsequent future mathematical calculations. Ideally, as their names suggest, we would want these columns
# to contain only digits from [0-9].</p>
# <p>Hence, we now proceed to clean our data. Specifically, the special characters <code>,</code> and <code>+</code>
# present in <code>Installs</code> column and <code>$ present in Price column need to be removed.
#
# It is also always a good practice to print a summary of your dataframe after completing data cleaning.
# We will use the info() method to acheive this.

# List of characters to remove
chars_to_remove = ['+', ',', '$']
# List of column names to clean
cols_to_clean = ['Installs', 'Price']

# Loop for each column in cols_to_clean
for col in cols_to_clean:
    # Loop for each char in chars_to_remove
    for char in chars_to_remove:
        # Replace the character with an empty string
        apps[col] = apps[col].apply(lambda x: x.replace(char, ''))

# Print a summary of the apps dataframe
print(apps.info())

# 3. Correcting data types
#
# From the previous task we noticed that Installs and Price were categorized as object data type
# (and not int or float) as we would like. This is because these two columns originally had mixed
# input types: digits and special characters. To know more about Pandas data types, read this.
#
# The four features that we will be working with most frequently henceforth are Installs, Size,
# Rating and Price. While Size and Rating are both float (i.e. purely numerical data types), we
# still need to work on Installs and Price to make them numeric.

import numpy as np

# Convert Installs to float data type
apps['Installs'] = apps['Installs'].astype(float)

# Convert Price to float data type
apps['Price'] = apps['Price'].astype(float)

# Checking dtypes of the apps dataframe
print(apps.dtypes)

# 4. Exploring app categories
#
# With more than 1 billion active users in 190 countries around the world, Google Play continues to be an important
# distribution platform to build a global audience. For businesses to get their apps in front of users, it's important
# to make them more quickly and easily discoverable on Google Play. To improve the overall search experience, Google
# has introduced the concept of grouping apps into categories.
#
# This brings us to the following questions:
#
#     Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market?
#     Is any specific category dominating the market?
#     Which categories have the fewest number of apps?
#
# We will see that there are 33 unique app categories present in our dataset. Family and Game apps have the highest
# market prevalence. Interestingly, Tools, Business and Medical apps are also at the top.

import plotly
plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
import plotly.graph_objs as go

# Print the total number of unique categories
num_categories = len(apps["Category"].unique())
print('Number of categories = ', num_categories)

# Count the number of apps in each 'Category'.
num_apps_in_category = apps["Category"].value_counts()

# Sort num_apps_in_category in descending order based on the count of apps in each category
sorted_num_apps_in_category = num_apps_in_category.sort_values(ascending=[False])

data = [go.Bar(
        x = num_apps_in_category.index, # index = category name
        y = num_apps_in_category.values, # value = count
)]

plotly.offline.iplot(data)

#
# 5. Distribution of app ratings
#
# After having witnessed the market share for each category of apps, let's see how all these apps perform on
# an average. App ratings (on a scale of 1 to 5) impact the discoverability, conversion of apps as well as the
# company's overall brand image. Ratings are a key performance indicator of an app.
#
# From our research, we found that the average volume of ratings across all app categories is 4.17. The histogram
# plot is skewed to the left indicating that the majority of the apps are highly rated with only a few exceptions
# in the low-rated apps.

# Average rating of apps
avg_app_rating = apps["Rating"].mean()
print('Average app rating = ', avg_app_rating)

# Distribution of apps according to their ratings
data = [go.Histogram(
        x = apps['Rating']
)]

# Vertical dashed line to indicate the average app rating
layout = {'shapes': [{
              'type' :'line',
              'x0': avg_app_rating,
              'y0': 0,
              'x1': avg_app_rating,
              'y1': 1000,
              'line': { 'dash': 'dashdot'}
          }]
          }

plotly.offline.iplot({'data': data, 'layout': layout})

# 6. Size and price of an app
#
# Let's now examine app size and app price. For size, if the mobile app is too large, it may be difficult
# and/or expensive for users to download. Lengthy download times could turn users off before they even experience
# your mobile app. Plus, each user's device has a finite amount of disk space. For price, some users expect
# their apps to be free or inexpensive. These problems compound if the developing world is part of your target
# market; especially due to internet speeds, earning power and exchange rates.
#
# How can we effectively come up with strategies to size and price our app?
#
#     Does the size of an app affect its rating?
#     Do users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?
#     Does the price of an app affect its rating?
#     Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?
#
# We find that the majority of top rated apps (rating over 4) range from 2 MB to 20 MB. We also find that the
# vast majority of apps price themselves under $10.

%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

# Select rows where both 'Rating' and 'Size' values are present (ie. the two values are not null)
apps_with_size_and_rating_present = apps.dropna(subset=["Rating", "Size"])

# Subset for categories with at least 250 apps
large_categories = apps_with_size_and_rating_present.groupby("Category").filter(lambda x: len(x) >= 250)

# Plot size vs. rating
plt1 = sns.jointplot(x = large_categories["Size"], y = large_categories["Rating"])

# Select apps whose 'Type' is 'Paid'
paid_apps = apps_with_size_and_rating_present[apps_with_size_and_rating_present['Type'] == 'Paid']

# Plot price vs. rating
plt2 = sns.jointplot(x = paid_apps['Price'], y = paid_apps['Rating'])

# 7. Relation between app category and app price
#
# So now comes the hard part. How are companies and developers supposed to make ends meet? What monetization
# strategies can companies use to maximize profit? The costs of apps are largely based on features, complexity,
# and platform.
#
# There are many factors to consider when selecting the right pricing strategy for your mobile app. It is
# important to consider the willingness of your customer to pay for your app. A wrong price could break the
# deal before the download even happens. Potential customers could be turned off by what they perceive to be
# a shocking cost, or they might delete an app theyâ€™ve downloaded after receiving too many ads or simply not
# getting their money's worth.
#
# Different categories demand different price ranges. Some apps that are simple and used daily, like the
# calculator app, should probably be kept free. However, it would make sense to charge for a highly-specialized
# medical app that diagnoses diabetic patients. Below, we see that Medical and Family apps are the most expensive.
# Some medical apps extend even up to $80! All game apps are reasonably priced below $20.
#
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(15, 8)

# Select a few popular app categories
popular_app_cats = apps[apps.Category.isin(['GAME', 'FAMILY', 'PHOTOGRAPHY',
                                            'MEDICAL', 'TOOLS', 'FINANCE',
                                            'LIFESTYLE','BUSINESS'])]

# Examine the price trend by plotting Price vs Category
ax = sns.stripplot(x = popular_app_cats['Price'], y = popular_app_cats['Category'], jitter=True, linewidth=1)
ax.set_title('App pricing trend across categories')

# Apps whose Price is greater than 200
apps_above_200 = apps[apps['Price'] > 200]
apps_above_200[['Category', 'App', 'Price']]

# 8. Filter out "junk" apps
#
# It looks like a bunch of the really expensive apps are "junk" apps. That is, apps that don't really have a purpose.
# Some app developer may create an app called I Am Rich Premium or most expensive app (H) just for a joke or to test
# their app development skills. Some developers even do this with malicious intent and try to make money by hoping
# people accidentally click purchase on their app in the store.
#
# Let's filter out these junk apps and re-do our visualization.

# Select apps priced below $100
apps_under_100 = popular_app_cats[popular_app_cats['Price'] < 100]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(15, 8)

# Examine price vs category with the authentic apps (apps_under_100)
ax = sns.stripplot(x = apps_under_100['Price'], y = apps_under_100['Category'], data = apps, jitter = True, linewidth = 1)
ax.set_title('App pricing trend across categories after filtering for junk apps')

# 9. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
#
# For apps in the Play Store today, there are five types of pricing strategies: free, freemium, paid, paymium, and
# subscription. Let's focus on free and paid apps only. Some characteristics of free apps are:
#
#     Free to download.
#     Main source of income often comes from advertisements.
#     Often created by companies that have other products and the app serves as an extension of those products.
#     Can serve as a tool for customer retention, communication, and customer service.
#
# Some characteristics of paid apps are:
#
#     Users are asked to pay once for the app to download and use it.
#     The user can't really get a feel for the app before buying it.
#
# Are paid apps installed as much as free apps? It turns out that paid apps have a relatively lower number of
# installs than free apps, though the difference is not as stark as I would have expected!

trace0 = go.Box(
    # Data for paid apps
    y = apps[apps['Type'] == 'Paid']['Installs'],
    name = 'Paid'
)

trace1 = go.Box(
    # Data for free apps
    y = apps[apps['Type'] == 'Free']['Installs'],
    name = 'Free'
)

layout = go.Layout(
    title = "Number of downloads of paid apps vs. free apps",
    yaxis = dict(title = "Log number of downloads",
                type = 'log',
                autorange = True)
)

# Add trace0 and trace1 to a list for plotting
data = [trace0, trace1]
plotly.offline.iplot({'data': data, 'layout': layout})

# 10. Sentiment analysis of user reviews
#
# Mining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand, or service can be
# done using a technique called sentiment analysis. User reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify
# if the mood is positive, negative or neutral about that app. For example, positive words in an app
# review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. Negative words
# might be words like 'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.
#
# By plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps, we observe that free
# apps receive a lot of harsh comments, as indicated by the outliers on the negative y-axis. Reviews
# for paid apps appear never to be extremely negative. This may indicate something about app quality,
# i.e., paid apps being of higher quality than free apps on average. The median polarity score for paid
# apps is a little higher than free apps, thereby syncing with our previous observation.
#
# In this notebook, we analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store. We can use our findings
# to inform our decisions should we ever wish to create an app ourselves.

# Load user_reviews.csv
reviews_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/user_reviews.csv')

# Join the two dataframes
merged_df = apps.merge(reviews_df)

# Drop NA values from Sentiment and Review columns
merged_df = merged_df.dropna(subset = ['Sentiment', 'Review'])

sns.set_style('ticks')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(11, 8)

# User review sentiment polarity for paid vs. free apps
ax = sns.boxplot(x = merged_df['Type'], y = merged_df['Sentiment_Polarity'], data = merged_df)
ax.set_title('Sentiment Polarity Distribution')
