    "\n",
    "By looking at a random sample of the dataset rows (from the above task), we observe that some entries in the columns like `Installs` and `Price` have a few special characters (+ , $) due to the way the numbers have been represented. This prevents the columns from being purely numeric, making it difficult to use them in subsequent future mathematical calculations. Ideally, as their names suggest, we would want these columns to contain only digits from [0-9].\n",
